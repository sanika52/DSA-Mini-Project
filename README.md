# Predictive Search System
This is an Autocomplete System built using a Trie (Prefix Tree). It efficiently
stores words and provides real-time word suggestions based on a user-provided
prefix. The system loads a list of words from a file into the Trie structure and,
using the prefix entered by the user, retrieves matching words. This can be
applied to search engines, text editors, or predictive typing interfaces.
